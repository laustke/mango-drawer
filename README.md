## Responsive Vanilla JavaScript Drawer

This repository contains the code for my video tutorial on creating a responsive sidebar menu using CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

This part only covers creating an drawer that slides in and out. 
You can watch the YouTube video for a step-by-step explanation of how it works.

For the full sidebar menu with dropdowns and submenus, please check the second part here: [mango-sidebar](https://github.com/laustke/mango-sidebar).
